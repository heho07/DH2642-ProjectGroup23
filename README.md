# DH2642_VT19_PG23
The git repository for project group 23 in the course DH2642 at KTH VT19

## YOU NEED TO RUN "npm install" in the main folder before running. This is due to the folder "node_modules" being ignored by git to save space on git.

How to run:
- clone the repository
- make sure you have npm installed on your computer 
- run "npm install" in the root folder (npm will in turn look at the "package.json" file to see which dependencies it needs to install)
- run "npm start" to deploy
